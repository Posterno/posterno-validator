## Installation

This is a development repository for the validator component and requires no installation for production sites because it's integrated within Posterno's core plugin.

For development purposes you can clone this repository within the same folder where the main "posterno" plugin folder is located so that composer can properly load it.

Then run

```
composer install
```

from within the main Posterno plugin folder.
